                <p class="cs-text">
                      the combination of the untimely death of founder, Rube Foster, and the devastating effects of the Great Depression led to the shuttering of the Negro National League I in 1931. Sensing the void, eager competitors looked to takeover. In stepped businessman Gus Greenlee who first entered baseball by purchasing the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1931. The team was reinvigorated under Greenlee's stewardship, becoming a top team for several years. In 1932, he built the famous Greenlee Field, one of the few Black owned and built baseball fields, which served as the home field for both the Crawfords and the Homestead Grays. Greenlee cemented his legacy by founding the second Negro National League (NNL II).

                    Established by Greenlee, this league was a bit more chaotic than its predecessor, featuring an erratic schedule that saw teams play an unequal amount of games each season. In the 1940s, they held the Negro World Series. Despite the talented players, financial mismanagement, disputed records, and primarily the integration in the MLB would lead to its collapse in 1948.

A long 10-game series, played at Schorlink Park in Chicago, resulted in KC beating Hilldale 5-0. The winning team earned approximately $308 each (~$5,400 today) and the losing team $193 each (~3,400).
