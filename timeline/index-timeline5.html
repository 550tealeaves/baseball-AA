                      On the day Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, it had been approximately 63 years since the last black man, Moses Fleetwood Walker, had played for the majors. Brooklyn Dodgers general manager is credited for bringing in Robinson, but the process of integration was ploddingly slow and carefully planned.

                    Robinson was carefully scouted to be the man to break the color line. He had to remain poised and dispassionate in the face of extreme racial animus. Rickey portrayed the Negro Leagues as a racketeer operation instead of a legitimate business to justify his refusal to pay the KC Monarchs for Robinson. This set the precedent of MLB teams stripping the Negro Leagues of their best players without proper compensation.<cite><sup><a href="../index-sources.html" target="_blank">30</a></sup></cite>
