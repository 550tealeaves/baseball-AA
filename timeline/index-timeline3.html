                <p class="cs-text">
                    The first Negro National League was the brainchild of renowned pitcher and team owner, <a href="../people/index-foster.html" target="_blank">Rube Foster</a>. An astute businessman, Foster noted that during the waning years of WWI, the Great Migration brought affluent African Americans up north. An all-black league would be a great source of entertainment. Indeed the first league was a success, popularizing the likes of Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, <a href="../people/index-gibson.html" target="_blank">Josh Gibson</a>, <a href="../people/index-charleston.html" target="_blank">Oscar Charleston</a>, and Turkey Stearns. The NNL was one of <strong>7</strong> Negro Leagues that formed in this time period. Overall, the Negro Leagues created an entire business economy, where the owners, coaches, players, and consumers were predominantly black.

                    Created by the only white owner in the Negro Leagues, J.L. Wilkinson, this was longest running franchise in the Negro Leagues. It was one of 8 teams originally in the NNLI. Among their many achievements is developing a method for night games using a lighting system, long before MLB. They won 10 championships, had only 1 season with a losing record (1944), and produced the most major league players in the Negro Leagues<cite><sup><a href="../index-sources.html" target="_blank">15,16</a></sup></cite>

A long 10-game series, played at Schorling Park in Chicago, resulted in KC beating Hilldale 5-0.
