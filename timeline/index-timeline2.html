                <p class="cs-text">
                    From 1887 to April 15, 1947, MLB had a gentlemen's agreement, an unofficial rule, not to sign any black players to any of their teams. Despite the racism, black players found alternative ways to continue playing. This period was marked by the rapid formation and collapse of several black baseball clubs.

                    The brainchild of former players, Bud Fowler and Grant "Home Run" Johnson, the Page Fence Giants were a tour de force. In 1897, they had an unbelievable 82-game win streak. Most noteworthy was their ability to draw relatively large crowds with their stunts and gimmicks and, consequently, compensate their players well.<cite><sup><a href="../index-sources.html">10</a></sup></cite>

                    This was the dominant team in the late 1890s and featured former players of the Cuban Giants. The team had an incredible pitcher, named Rube Foster, who led them to victory in the 1903 Colored World Championship. The Cuban X Giants were the first team all-black team to play in Cuba and the first all-black team to defeat a white major league team.
                    In 1906, they were a founding member of the National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States and Cuba. They helped pioneer the way for black players to play internationally, where they were often treated better than at home.

                    Key players included John Henry "Pop" Lloyd, Dan McClellan, Bobby Winston, Harry Buckner.<cite><sup><a href="../index-sources.html">11</a></sup></cite>

                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    This team was created by a black banker, named Charles A. Mills and won the St. Louis City League Championships back-to-back in 1912 and 1913. 
                    In 1921, the team was sold to Dick Kent and Dr. Sam Sheppard and renamed the St. Louis Stars. The Stars played in one of the few places specifically for black baseball clubs, Stars Park.
