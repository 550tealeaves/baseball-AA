                <p class="cs-text">
                      Once the color barrier broke and owners realized the profits they could make acquiring black players, the fate of the Negro Leagues was sealed. Long plagued with economic hardships, stemming from the effects of Jim Crow, the Negro Leagues pushed forward in spite of it all. Beginning its economic collapse, the MLB plundered the Negro Leagues of their best players, causing a mass exodus of black fans who opted to follow their favorite players to the white leagues. The loss of both assets (players) and revenue (customers) drove many of the leagues to a quick bankruptcy or forced owners to sell at a heavy losses. Moreover, the message changed and the Negro Leagues were villainized as emblematic of America's racist past that the black community so desperately wanted to move on from. The painful irony is that the Negro Leagues, once a symbol of the sheer ingenuity of black enterprise, could no longer exist because it reminded the MLB its cruel actions.

                    The end of the NNL II marks the end of an era of major black enterprise, never to return to baseball. It had 6 teams (Homestead Grays, Baltimore Elite Giants, Newark Eagles, Philadelphia Stars, New York Cubans, & New York Black Yankees), half of which went bankrupt.<cite><sup><a href="../sections/sources.html" target="_blank">37, 39</a></sup></cite>

                    As the best players moved to the MLB, the fans migrated over, as well. Negro League team owners struggled to sell tickets. The quality of play declined, and several teams either went bankrupt or were sold at a huge loss.  
                    <br />
                    Chicago American Giants, Newark (renamed to Houston) Eagles, and Homestead Grays all closed. 
                    <br />
                    Research has shown that teams were often more successful traveling to different areas and challenging teams. Unfortunately, both the fans and the press had moved on.<cite><sup><a href="../sections/sources.html" target="_blank">37</a></sup></cite>
