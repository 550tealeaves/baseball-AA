                <p class="cs-text">
                      Once the color barrier broke and owners realized the profits they could make acquiring black players, the fate of the Negro Leagues was sealed. Long plagued with economic hardships, stemming from the effects of Jim Crow, the Negro Leagues pushed forward in spite of it all. Beginning its economic collapse, the MLB plundered the Negro Leagues of their best players, causing a mass exodus of black fans who opted to follow their favorite players to the white leagues. The loss of both assets (players) and revenue (customers) drove many of the leagues to a quick bankruptcy or forced owners to sell at a heavy losses. Moreover, the message changed and the Negro Leagues were villainized as a symbol of America's racist past that they so desperately wanted to "move on" from. The painful irony is that the Negro Leagues, once a symbol of the sheer ingenuity of black enterprise, could no longer exist because it reminded the MLB its cruel actions.

                    By the time many of those players returned, they were no longer in their physical prime. Branch Rickey realized the necessity of planning baseball's future by looking towards the Negro Leagues. He framed integration as inevitable and profitable.

                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    Robinson was carefully scouted to be the man to break the color line. He had to remain poised and dispassionate in the face of extreme racial animus. Rickey portrayed the Negro Leagues as a racketeer operation instead of a legitimate business to justify his refusal to pay the KC Monarchs for Robinson. This set the precedent of MLB teams stripping the Negro Leagues of their best players without proper compensation.
