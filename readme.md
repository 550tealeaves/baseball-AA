This capstone project is the first step in creating a comprehensive repository of data on the Negro Leagues for a younger audience. The impact of the Negro Leagues on the Black community was profound, and its loss has manifested in the declining numbers of African American players in baseball. Currently, this project includes a website with an overview, a timeline of events pre-post and Negro Leagues, a list of notable figures, and select interactive visualizations. 

The future goal is to convert this into an image map, designed in the style of a game, with clickable elements that can re-route to various parts of this website. Currently, the audience is general, but future iterations will be tailored to children ages 5-12, using a mixture of animations, bold colors, and shapes. Despite the present disconnect between baseball and the younger generation, this is a sport with a rich legacy of African American achievement that children should learn about.
