This capstone project is the first step in creating a comprehensive repository of data on the Negro Leagues. The impact of the Negro Leagues on the black community was profound and its loss is still being felt in the declining numbers of African Americans in baseball. Currently this project includes a website with a brief overview, timeline of events pre-post and Negro Leagues, notable figures, and some interactive datasets.
While the current audience is general, in the future, I hope to format this for a much younger audience of children. Despite the disconnect between baseball and young African American children, I still believe that this is a sport that should be accessible. 

Ideally, this entire website will be depicted as a game, demonstrating the important contributions of African American players to baseball. 

The game would allow the users to select each base and view the linear history of African Americans in baseball, with a strong focus on the Negro Leagues. Next, the user can select specific players on the screen, consisting of a mixture of past and present African American players. The user can then select the scoreboard and see the statistics of players and teams. The user can also select the seating area and learn more about African American attendance and viewership at baseball games. Largely the information will be presented as interactive graphs with accompanying short paragraphs summarizing the results. 

However, all of this is theoretical. I do not yet possess the knowledge on how to create the game or which programming language to use.
