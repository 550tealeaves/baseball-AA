This capstone project is the first step in creating a comprehensive repository of data on the Negro Leagues for a younger audience. The impact of the Negro Leagues on the black community was profound and its loss is still being felt in the declining numbers of African Americans in baseball. Currently this project includes a website with a brief overview, timeline of events pre-post and Negro Leagues, notable figures, and some interactive datasets. The future goal is to convert this into an image map with clickable elements that can re-route to different parts of the map.

While the current audience is general, in the future, I hope to format this for a much younger audience. Using an animated style, bold colors, and shapes, this website would be tailored for children ages 5-12. Despite the present disconnect between baseball and young African American children, this is a sport with a rich legacy of AFrican American achievement that children should learn about.
